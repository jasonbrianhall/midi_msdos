# Overview

A simple MIDI Player based on a QBasic Program and the OPL3SA chipset from dosbox

## Limitations

This version is not as sophisticated as the Linux version.  It will only play a limited number of midi files due to the limitations of the OPL3SA chipset.  If I wanted it to play all MIDI files, I would have to do some type of Sound Blaster processing and output it through SB16 instead.
